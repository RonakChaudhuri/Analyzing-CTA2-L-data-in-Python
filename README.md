Project 01 : Analyzing CTA2 L data in Python
Assignment: Python program to analyze CTA2 L data stored in SQLite

Overview

The goal in project 01 is to write a console-based Python program that inputs commands from the user 
and outputs data from the CTA2 L daily ridership database. The program starts by outputting some basic stats 
retrieved from the database:

** Welcome to CTA L analysis app **
General stats:
 # of stations: 147
 # of stops: 302
 # of ride entries: 1,070,894
 date range: 2001-01-01 - 2021-07-31
 Total ridership: 3,377,404,512
 Weekday ridership: 2,778,644,946 (82.27%)
 Saturday ridership: 330,165,977 (9.78%)
 Sunday/holiday ridership: 268,593,589 (7.95%)
Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit):

The percentages shown in the last 3 outputs are computed using Python; all other data shown is retrieved / 
computed using SQL. This is a project requirement. You’ll also need to match the output exactly. Note that 
these values may change based on the database tested against; when you submit to Gradescope for testing, 
we reserve the right to change the contents of the database (the schema will remain the same, but the 
underlying data may change to confirm you are writing a general-purpose program).

After the stats, the program starts a command-loop, inputting string-based commands “1” – “9” or “x” to 
exit. All other inputs should yield an error message:

Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 0
**Error, unknown command, try again...
Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 10
**Error, unknown command, try again...
Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): help
**Error, unknown command, try again...

Some of the commands are simpler, e.g. command “3” outputs the top-10 stations in terms of ridership:

Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 3
** top-10 stations **
Lake/State : 100,419,088 (2.97%)
Clark/Lake : 100,088,085 (2.96%)
Chicago/State : 91,899,932 (2.72%)
Belmont-North Main : 74,452,064 (2.20%)
95th/Dan Ryan : 74,235,360 (2.20%)
Fullerton : 72,888,906 (2.16%)
Grand/State : 68,379,115 (2.02%)
O'Hare Airport : 66,363,838 (1.96%)
Jackson/State : 61,803,911 (1.83%)
Roosevelt : 61,487,262 (1.82%)

Note these answers may change based on the database tested against. Some of the commands are more 
challenging, and will require plotting. For example, command “8” compares ridership at two different stations 
for a given year:

Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 8
Year to compare against? 2020
Enter station 1 (wildcards _ and %): %uic%
Enter station 2 (wildcards _ and %): %sox%
Station 1: 40350 UIC-Halsted
2020-01-01 958
2020-01-02 2143
2020-01-03 2215
2020-01-04 1170
2020-01-05 840
2020-12-27 327
2020-12-28 426
2020-12-29 438
2020-12-30 429
2020-12-31 363
Station 2: 40190 Sox-35th-Dan Ryan
2020-01-01 1747
2020-01-02 2865
2020-01-03 3206
2020-01-04 1907
2020-01-05 1612
2020-12-27 424
2020-12-28 664
2020-12-29 749 
2020-12-30 757
2020-12-31 694
Plot? (y/n) y

If the user responds with “y” your program should plot as follows (with appropriate title, legend, and axis 
labels):

If the user responds with any other input, do not plot. [ This will be important for Gradescope testing. ] 
The program should repeat until the user inputs “x” to exit the command loop. The user can input 
commands in any order, and may repeat commands as often as they want. The next section will detail the 
expected output from each command “1” – “9”.

CTA2: an update to the original CTA database
The CTA2 database consists of 5 tables: Stations, Stops, Ridership, StopDetails, and Lines. This is the same 
database that was used in Homework 2. The following information about the database is the same 
information that was provided in Homework 2 (i.e. we haven’t snuck anything in to attempt to trip you up). 
This provides information about both stations and stops in the L system:

Here’s more detail about the CTA2 database:
Stations:
- Denotes the stations on the CTA system. A station can have one or more stops, e.g. 
“Chicago/Franklin” has 2 stops
- Station_ID: primary key, integer
- Station_Name: string
Stops:
- Denotes the stops on the CTA system. For example, “Chicago (Loop-bound)” is one of the 
stops at the “Chicago/Franklin” station; a Southbound stop, and handicap-accessible (ADA)
- Stop_ID: primary key, integer
- Station_ID of station this stop is associated with: foreign key, integer
- Stop_Name: string
- Direction: a string that is one of N, E, S, W
- ADA: integer, 1 if the stop is handicap-accessible, 0 if not
- Latitude and Longitude: position, real numbers
Lines:
- Denotes the CTA lines, e.g. “Red” line or “Blue” line
Page 5 of 17 
- Line_ID: primary key, integer
- Color: string
StopDetails: 
- A stop may be on one or more CTA lines — e.g. “Chicago (Loop-bound)”, stop 30138, is on 
the Brown and Purple-Express lines
- One row of StopDetail denotes one unique pair (stop_id, line_id) --- if a stop is on multiple 
lines such as “Chicago (Loop-bound)”, it will have multiple StopDetail pairs
- Stop_ID: foreign key, integer
- Line_ID: foreign key, integer
- The pair (Stop_ID, Line_ID) forms a composite primary key
Ridership:
- Denotes how many riders went through the turnstile at this station on this date
- Station_ID: foreign key, integer
- Ride_Date: string in format “yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.sss”
- Type_of_Day: string, where ‘W’ denotes a weekday, ‘A’ denotes Saturday, and ‘U’ denotes 
Sunday or Holiday
- Num_Riders: integer, total # of riders who went through the turnstile on this date
- The pair (Station_ID, Ride_Date) forms a composite primary key
What is a foreign key? A foreign key is a primary key stored in another table, typically used to join those 
tables. Think of a foreign key as a pointer to the table where it’s a primary key. Example: Station_ID is the 
primary key of the Stations table, and a foreign key in the Stops and Ridership tables --- this allows the Stops 
and Ridership tables to point to the station name in case it’s needed.

Program functionality

Command “1”
Input a partial station name from the user (SQL wildcards _ and % allowed) and retrieve the stations that 
are “like” the user’s input. Output station names in ascending order. If no stations are found, say so:

Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 1
Enter partial station name (wildcards _ and %): %uic%
40350 : UIC-Halsted
Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 1
Enter partial station name (wildcards _ and %): lake
**No stations found...
Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 1
Enter partial station name (wildcards _ and %): FOSTE_
40520 : Foster
Page 6 of 17
Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 1
Enter partial station name (wildcards _ and %): %lake
40170 : Ashland-Lake
41260 : Austin-Lake
41360 : California-Lake
40280 : Central-Lake
40480 : Cicero-Lake
40380 : Clark/Lake
41160 : Clinton-Lake
40020 : Harlem-Lake
41070 : Kedzie-Lake
41510 : Morgan-Lake
41350 : Oak Park-Lake
40030 : Pulaski-Lake
40260 : State/Lake

Note that the SQL command you need to execute is parameterized based on the user’s input. How do you do 
this? The simplest way is to write the SQL query with a ? where you would normally place the value, e.g.

sql = "Select … Where Station_Name like ? …"
Then, when you execute the query, you provide the value to the execute( ) function:
dbCursor.execute(sql, [value_to_insert_into_query])

Command “2”
Output the ridership at each station, in ascending order by station name. Along with each value, output the 
percentage this value represents across the total L ridership. The totals must be computed using SQL, the 
percentages can be computed using Python (output values on the next page are omitted for brevity):
Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 2
** ridership all stations **
18th : 9,248,879 (0.27%)
35-Bronzeville-IIT : 12,800,451 (0.38%)
35th/Archer : 16,229,257 (0.48%)
43rd : 5,973,445 (0.18%)
47th-Dan Ryan : 18,648,390 (0.55%)
.
.
.
Western-Cermak : 5,803,238 (0.17%)
Western-Forest Park : 8,814,396 (0.26%)
Western-Orange : 20,905,905 (0.62%)
Western/Milwaukee : 26,646,085 (0.79%)
Wilson : 35,862,893 (1.06%)

I would recommend using Python to format the output. Here’s one way to format each line of the output:
print(stationname, ":", f"{ridership:,}", f"({percentage:.2f}%)")
In a print statement, the “f” stands for formatted output. The “:,” after the ridership variable means format 
that value with “,” separators. The “:.2f” after the percentage variable means output the value with 2 digits
following the decimal point.

Command “3”
Output the top-10 busiest stations in terms of ridership, in descending order by ridership:

Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 3
** top-10 stations **
Lake/State : 100,419,088 (2.97%)
Clark/Lake : 100,088,085 (2.96%)
Chicago/State : 91,899,932 (2.72%)
Belmont-North Main : 74,452,064 (2.20%)
95th/Dan Ryan : 74,235,360 (2.20%)
Fullerton : 72,888,906 (2.16%)
Grand/State : 68,379,115 (2.02%)
O'Hare Airport : 66,363,838 (1.96%)
Jackson/State : 61,803,911 (1.83%)
Roosevelt : 61,487,262 (1.82%)

As in command #2, use SQL to compute the totals and the order, and Python to compute the percentages. 
Similar output formatting as in command #2.

Command “4”
Output the least-10 busiest stations in terms of ridership, in ascending order by ridership:

Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 4
** least-10 stations **
Homan : 27 (0.00%)
Oakton-Skokie : 2,188,410 (0.06%)
Kostner : 2,471,822 (0.07%)
Cermak-McCormick Place : 2,721,448 (0.08%)
King Drive : 3,931,290 (0.12%)
Noyes : 4,488,208 (0.13%)
South Boulevard : 4,691,607 (0.14%)
Halsted/63rd : 4,707,290 (0.14%)
Foster : 4,772,450 (0.14%)
Indiana : 4,942,648 (0.15%)

Command “5”
Input a line color from the user and output all stop names that are part of that line, in ascending order. If 
the line does not exist, say so:

Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 5
Enter a line color (e.g. Red or Yellow): yellow
Dempster-Skokie (Arrival) : direction = N (accessible? yes)
Dempster-Skokie (Howard-bound) : direction = S (accessible? yes)
Howard (Linden & Skokie-bound) : direction = N (accessible? yes)
Howard (Terminal arrival) : direction = S (accessible? yes)
Oakton-Skokie (Dempster-Skokie-bound) : direction = N (accessible? yes)
Oakton-Skokie (Howard-bound) : direction = S (accessible? yes)
Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 5
Enter a line color (e.g. Red or Yellow): Magenta
**No such line...

Notice the stop’s direction is also output, along with whether the station is handicap-accessible or not. A stop 
is handicap-accessible if its ADA value is 1. The user’s input should be treated as case-insensitive, e.g. “yellow” 
and “YELLOW” are considered the same. Do not hard-code the colors of the L lines into your Python program; 
the existence of a line color in the L system can easily be determined by looking at the result of your SQL 
query. Note that “Purple” and “Purple-Express” are considered separate lines in the L system.

Command “6”
Outputs total ridership by month, in ascending order by month. After the output, the user is given the 
option to plot the data:
Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 6
** ridership by month **
01 : 267,762,005
02 : 261,119,280
03 : 286,169,400
04 : 276,946,650
05 : 285,049,263
06 : 290,602,705
07 : 296,482,279
08 : 291,240,598
09 : 292,374,159
10 : 310,014,434
11 : 271,381,428
12 : 248,262,311
Plot? (y/n) y
If the user responds with “y” your program should plot as follows (with appropriate title and axis labels):

If the user responds with any other input, do not plot. [ This will be important for Gradescope testing. ]
Plotting in Python is straightforward using the matplotlib.pyplot package, which is assumed to be imported as 
follows:
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
Here’s the approach for plotting a series of (x, y) coordinates in a line plot:
x = [] # create 2 empty vectors/lists
y = []
 
for row in rows: # append each (x, y) coordinate that you want to plot
 x.append(…)
 y.append(…)
 
plt.xlabel("…")
plt.ylabel("…")
plt.title("…")
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()

If you need to plot multiple lines, you call plot() once for each line, and then call show() at the end.

Command “7”
Outputs total ridership by year, in ascending order by year. After the output, the user is given the option to 
plot the data:

Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 7
** ridership by year **
2001 : 151,739,502
2002 : 152,364,552
2003 : 150,319,580
2004 : 148,312,412
2005 : 154,987,157

2016 : 195,555,726
2017 : 188,665,453
2018 : 185,146,121
2019 : 179,071,205
2020 : 62,340,303
2021 : 31,224,318
Plot? (y/n) y

If the user responds with “y” your program should plot as follows (with appropriate title and axis labels):
If the user responds with any other input, do not plot. [ This will be important for Gradescope testing. ] 

Command “8”
Inputs a year and the names of two stations (full or partial names), and then outputs the daily ridership at 
each station for that year. Since the output would be quite long, you should only output the first 5 days and 
last 5 days of data for each station (as shown below):

Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 8
Year to compare against? 2020
Enter station 1 (wildcards _ and %): %uic%
Enter station 2 (wildcards _ and %): %sox%

2020-12-31 694
Plot? (y/n) y

If the user responds with “y” your program should plot as 
follows (with appropriate title, legend, and axis labels) ------->
If the user responds with any other input, do not plot. If the 
first station name entered by the user does not exist --- or 
yields multiple stations --- the command should abort 
immediately with an error message:

Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 8
Year to compare against? 2020
Enter station 1 (wildcards _ and %): uic
**No station found...
Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit):
Here’s what should happen if the station name matches multiple stations:
Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 8
Year to compare against? 2020
Enter station 1 (wildcards _ and %): %uic%
Enter station 2 (wildcards _ and %): %lake%
**Multiple stations found...
Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit):

If both station names match exactly one station, the command should output the data for each station
(station 1 followed by station 2), and then prompt to plot. Note that if the user enters a year for which there is 
no data, no error message is necessary --- the output and plot will be empty, which is sufficient.

Command “9” 
Input a line color from the user and output all station names that are part of that line, in ascending order. 
You will most likely get duplicates, use SQL’s “distinct” to delete the duplicates for you before outputting. If 
the line does not exist, say so:

Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 9
Enter a line color (e.g. Red or Yellow): magenta
**No such line...
Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 9
Enter a line color (e.g. Red or Yellow): yellow
Dempster-Skokie : (42.038951, -87.751919)
Howard : (42.019063, -87.672892)
Oakton-Skokie : (42.02624348, -87.74722084)
Plot? (y/n) n

Also output the (latitude, longitude) position of each station, which are retrieved from the Stops table (assume 
all the stops for a given station have the same position). You’ll need to use a Python formatted string to get 
the output to match what you see above. As in command #5, the user’s input should be treated as caseinsensitive, e.g. “yellow” and “YELLOW” are considered the same.

Also, do not hard-code the colors of the L 
lines into your Python program; the existence of a line color in the L system can easily be determined by 
looking at the result of your SQL query.

The more interesting output is the plot, where we plot the locations of the stations overlaying a map of 
Chicagoland. The map is provided as an image (.png) file (on replit.com or separately as noted in the “Getting 
Started” section). Here’s an example of the Blue line (some values are omitted for brevity):

Please enter a command (1-9, x to exit): 9
Enter a line color (e.g. Red or Yellow): blue
Addison-O'Hare : (41.94738, -87.71906)
Austin-Forest Park : (41.870851, -87.776812)
Belmont-O'Hare : (41.938132, -87.712359)
.

Western-Forest Park : (41.875478, -87.688436)
Western/Milwaukee : (41.916157, -87.687364)
Plot? (y/n) y

Here’s the plot that should be produced --- the quality will be better if you are able to use an environment 
such as Spyder where the plots can appear as separate figure windows (vs. inline within the environment):
This turns out to be surprisingly easy to do in Python. First, make sure the “chicago.png” image file is in the 
same folder as your Python program and the CTA2 database file. Then do the following:

#
# populate x and y lists with (x, y) coordinates --- note that longitude
# are the X values and latitude are the Y values
#
x = []
x = []
.
.
.
image = plt.imread("chicago.png")
xydims = [-87.9277, -87.5569, 41.7012, 42.0868] # area covered by the map:
plt.imshow(image, extent=xydims)
 
plt.title(color + " line")
# 
# color is the value input by user, we can use that to plot the
# figure *except* we need to map Purple-Express to Purple:
# 
if (color.lower() == "purple-express"):
 color="Purple" # color="#800080"
 
plt.plot(x, y, "o", c=color)
# 
# annotate each (x, y) coordinate with its station name:
# 
for row in rows:
 plt.annotate(the_station_name, (xposition, yposition))
 
plt.xlim([-87.9277, -87.5569])
plt.ylim([41.7012, 42.0868])
 
plt.show()
In case you’re curious, here’s how I created the image file, and where the xydims / xlim / ylim values came 
from:
# Map grid from min and max position values in the CTA data:
# 
# Longitude (x): -87.90422307|-87.605857
# Latitude (y): 41.722377|42.073153
# 
# How to get map image? 
# 1. https://www.openstreetmap.org
# 2. search for say "Chicago"
# 3. click on export in title bar
# 4. click on "manually select a different area"
# 5. resize the box
# 6. screenshot the box, save as .png file
# 7. record the 4 coordinates of the box
